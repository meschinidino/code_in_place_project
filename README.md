# code_in_place_project
Final project for Code in Place by Dino Meschini
This program is a game where you have to guess the chosen word by giving the programs
the letter you think might be in the secret word. You are given 8 lives or guesses, which
means that if you were to guess incorrectly, one point of your guess pool would be taken.
If you get to 0 points, the game ends and you lose.
If you guessed correctly, the letter you guessed will be displayed at the place where it is
supposed to be.
If your guess is a letter that you have already guessed before, and doesn't repeat itself in
the word, no lives will be taken and your progress will remain the same.
Changing the Lexicon is easy, you just have to change a variable at the beginning of a program,
allowing the user to choose their own word list to guess from.

Thank you Chris, Mehran and Brahm for teaching me everything I used in this program, thank you
for the amazing classes and pop culture references. I enjoyed Code in Place and decided to start
my journey to learn more about programming.
